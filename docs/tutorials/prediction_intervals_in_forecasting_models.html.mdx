# Introduction

The target of our prediction is something unknown (otherwise we wouldn’t
be making a prediction), so we can think of it as a random variable. For
example, the total sales for the next month could have different
possible values, and we won’t know what the exact value will be until we
get the actual sales at the end of the month. Until next month’s sales
are known, this is a random amount.

By the time the next month draws near, we usually have a pretty good
idea of possible sales values. However, if we are forecasting sales for
the same month next year, the possible values can vary much more. In
most forecasting cases, the variability associated with what we are
forecasting reduces as we get closer to the event. In other words, the
further back in time we make the prediction, the more uncertainty there
is.

We can imagine many possible future scenarios, each yielding a different
value for what we are trying to forecast.

When we obtain a forecast, we are estimating the middle of the range of
possible values the random variable could take. Often, a forecast is
accompanied by a prediction interval giving a range of values the random
variable could take with relatively high probability. For example, a 95%
prediction interval contains a range of values which should include the
actual future value with probability 95%.

Rather than plotting individual possible futures , we usually show these
prediction intervals instead.

When we generate a forecast, we usually produce a single value known as
the point forecast. This value, however, doesn’t tell us anything about
the uncertainty associated with the forecast. To have a measure of this
uncertainty, we need prediction intervals.

A prediction interval is a range of values that the forecast can take
with a given probability. Hence, a 95% prediction interval should
contain a range of values that include the actual future value with
probability 95%. Probabilistic forecasting aims to generate the full
forecast distribution. Point forecasting, on the other hand, usually
returns the mean or the median or said distribution. However, in
real-world scenarios, it is better to forecast not only the most
probable future outcome, but many alternative outcomes as well.

The problem is that some timeseries models provide forecast
distributions, but some other ones only provide point forecasts. How can
we then estimate the uncertainty of predictions?

# Forecasts and prediction intervals

There are at least four sources of uncertainty in forecasting using time
series models:

1.  The random error term;
2.  The parameter estimates;
3.  The choice of model for the historical data;
4.  The continuation of the historical data generating process into the
    future.

When we produce prediction intervals for time series models, we
generally only take into account the first of these sources of
uncertainty. It would be possible to account for 2 and 3 using
simulations, but that is almost never done because it would take too
much time to compute. As computing speeds increase, it might become a
viable approach in the future.

Even if we ignore the model uncertainty and the DGP uncertainty (sources
3 and 4), and just try to allow for parameter uncertainty as well as the
random error term (sources 1 and 2), there are no closed form solutions
apart from some simple special cases. see full article [Rob J
Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/)

## Forecast distributions

We use forecast distributions to express the uncertainty in our
predictions. These probability distributions describe the probability of
observing different future values using the fitted model. The point
forecast corresponds to the mean of this distribution. Most time series
models generate forecasts that follow a normal distribution, which
implies that we assume that possible future values follow a normal
distribution. However, later in this section we will look at some
alternatives to normal distributions.

### Importance of Confidence Interval Prediction in Time Series:

1.  Uncertainty Estimation: The confidence interval provides a measure
    of the uncertainty associated with time series predictions. It
    enables variability and the range of possible future values to be
    quantified, which is essential for making informed decisions.

2.  Precision evaluation: By having a confidence interval, the precision
    of the predictions can be evaluated. If the interval is narrow, it
    indicates that the forecast is more accurate and reliable. On the
    other hand, if the interval is wide, it indicates greater
    uncertainty and less precision in the predictions.

3.  Risk management: The confidence interval helps in risk management by
    providing information about possible future scenarios. It allows
    identifying the ranges in which the real values could be located and
    making decisions based on those possible scenarios.

4.  Effective communication: The confidence interval is a useful tool
    for communicating predictions clearly and accurately. It allows the
    variability and uncertainty associated with the predictions to be
    conveyed to the stakeholders, avoiding a wrong or overly optimistic
    interpretation of the results.

Therefore, confidence interval prediction in time series is essential to
understand and manage uncertainty, assess the accuracy of predictions,
and make informed decisions based on possible future scenarios.

## Prediction intervals

A prediction interval gives us a range in which we expect $y_t$ to lie
with a specified probability. For example, if we assume that the
distribution of future observations follows a normal distribution, a 95%
prediction interval for the forecast of step h would be represented by
the range

$$\hat{y}_{T+h|T} \pm 1.96 \hat\sigma_h,$$

Where $\hat\sigma_h$ is an estimate of the standard deviation of the h
-step forecast distribution.

More generally, a prediction interval can be written as

$$\hat{y}_{T+h|T} \pm c \hat\sigma_h$$

In this context, the term “multiplier c” is associated with the
probability of coverage. In this article, intervals of 80% and 95% are
typically calculated, but any other percentage can be used. The table
below shows the values of c corresponding to different coverage
probabilities, assuming a normal forecast distribution.

| Percentage | Multiplier |
|------------|------------|
| 50         | 0.67       |
| 55         | 0.76       |
| 60         | 0.84       |
| 65         | 0.93       |
| 70         | 1.04       |
| 75         | 1.15       |
| 80         | 1.28       |
| 85         | 1.44       |
| 90         | 1.64       |
| 95         | 1.96       |
| 96         | 2.05       |
| 97         | 2.17       |
| 98         | 2.33       |
| 99         | 2.58       |

Prediction intervals are valuable because they reflect the uncertainty
in the predictions. If we only generate point forecasts, we cannot
assess how accurate those forecasts are. However, by providing
prediction intervals, the amount of uncertainty associated with each
forecast becomes apparent. For this reason, point forecasts may lack
significant value without the inclusion of corresponding forecast
intervals.

## One-step prediction intervals

When making a prediction for a future step, it is possible to estimate
the standard deviation of the forecast distribution using the standard
deviation of the residuals, which is calculated by

where $K$ is the number of parameters estimated in the forecasting
method, and $M$ is the number of missing values in the residuals. (For
example, $M=1$ for a naive forecast, because we can’t forecast the first
observation.)

## Multi-step prediction intervals

A typical feature of forecast intervals is that they tend to increase in
length as the forecast horizon lengthens. As we move further out in
time, there is greater uncertainty associated with the prediction,
resulting in wider prediction intervals. In general, σh tends to
increase as h increases (although there are some nonlinear forecasting
methods that do not follow this property).

To generate a prediction interval, it is necessary to have an estimate
of σh. As mentioned above, for one-step forecasts (h=1), equation (1)
provides a good estimate of the standard deviation of the forecast, σ1.
However, for multi-step forecasts, a more complex calculation method is
required. These calculations assume that the residuals are uncorrelated
with each other.

## Benchmark methods

For the four benchmark methods, it is possible to mathematically derive
the forecast standard deviation under the assumption of uncorrelated
residuals. If $\hat{\sigma}_h$ denotes the standard deviation of the $h$
-step forecast distribution, and $\hat{\sigma}$ is the residual standard
deviation given by (1), then we can use the expressions shown in next
Table. Note that when $h=1$ and $T$ is large, these all give the same
approximate value $\hat{\sigma}$.

| Method                   | h-step forecast standard deviation         |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Mean forecasts           | $\hat\sigma_h = \hat\sigma\sqrt{1 + 1/T}$  |
| Naïve forecasts          | $\hat\sigma_h = \hat\sigma\sqrt{h}$        |
| Seasonal naïve forecasts | $\hat\sigma_h = \hat\sigma\sqrt{k+1}$      |
| Drift forecasts          | $\hat\sigma_h = \hat\sigma\sqrt{h(1+h/T)}$ |

Note that when $h=1$ and $T$ is large, these all give the same
approximate value $\hat{\sigma}$.

## Prediction intervals from bootstrapped residuals

When a normal distribution for the residuals is an unreasonable
assumption, one alternative is to use bootstrapping, which only assumes
that the residuals are uncorrelated with constant variance. We will
illustrate the procedure using a naïve forecasting method.

A one-step forecast error is defined as $e_t = y_t - \hat{y}_{t|t-1}$.
For a naïve forecasting method, $\hat{y}_{t|t-1} = y_{t-1}$, so we can
rewrite this as $$y_t = y_{t-1} + e_t.$$

Assuming future errors will be similar to past errors, when $t>T$ we can
replace $e_{t}$ by sampling from the collection of errors we have seen
in the past (i.e., the residuals). So we can simulate the next
observation of a time series using

$$y^*_{T+1} = y_{T} + e^*_{T+1}$$

where $e^*_{T+1}$ is a randomly sampled error from the past, and
$y^*_{T+1}$ is the possible future value that would arise if that
particular error value occurred. We use We use a \* to indicate that
this is not the observed $y_{T+1}$ value, but one possible future that
could occur. Adding the new simulated observation to our data set, we
can repeat the process to obtain

$$y^*_{T+2} = y_{T+1}^* + e^*_{T+2},$$

where $e^*_{T+2}$ is another draw from the collection of residuals.
Continuing in this way, we can simulate an entire set of future values
for our time series.

## Conformal Prediction

Multi-quantile losses and statistical models can provide provide
prediction intervals, but the problem is that these are uncalibrated,
meaning that the actual frequency of observations falling within the
interval does not align with the confidence level associated with it.
For example, a calibrated 95% prediction interval should contain the
true value 95% of the time in repeated sampling. An uncalibrated 95%
prediction interval, on the other hand, might contain the true value
only 80% of the time, or perhaps 99% of the time. In the first case, the
interval is too narrow and underestimates the uncertainty, while in the
second case, it is too wide and overestimates the uncertainty.

Statistical methods also assume normality. Here, we talk about another
method called conformal prediction that doesn’t require any
distributional assumptions.

Conformal prediction intervals use cross-validation on a point
forecaster model to generate the intervals. This means that no prior
probabilities are needed, and the output is well-calibrated. No
additional training is needed, and the model is treated as a black box.
The approach is compatible with any model

[mlforecast](https://github.com/nixtla/mlforecast) now supports
Conformal Prediction on all available models.

## The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that
determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit
roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null
hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly
time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null
hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not
stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the
alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data
is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as
stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative.
Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test is a common statistical test used to test
whether a given time series is stationary or not. We can achieve this by
defining the null and alternate hypothesis.

-   Null Hypothesis: Time Series is non-stationary. It gives a
    time-dependent trend.

-   Alternate Hypothesis: Time Series is stationary. In another term,
    the series doesn’t depend on time.

-   ADF or t Statistic \< critical values: Reject the null hypothesis,
    time series is stationary.

-   ADF or t Statistic \> critical values: Failed to reject the null
    hypothesis, time series is non-stationary.

```python
def augmented_dickey_fuller_test(series , column_name):
    print (f'Dickey-Fuller test results for columns: {column_name}')
    dftest = adfuller(series, autolag='AIC')
    dfoutput = pd.Series(dftest[0:4], index=['Test Statistic','p-value','No Lags Used','Number of observations used'])
    for key,value in dftest[4].items():
       dfoutput['Critical Value (%s)'%key] = value
    print (dfoutput)
    if dftest[1] <= 0.05:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("Reject the null hypothesis")
        print("The data is stationary")
    else:
        print("Conclusion:====>")
        print("The null hypothesis cannot be rejected")
        print("The data is not stationary")
```

## Autocorrelation plots

### Autocorrelation Function

**Definition 1.** Let $\{x_t;1 ≤ t ≤ n\}$ be a time series sample of
size n from $\{X_t\}$. 1. $\bar x = \sum_{t=1}^n \frac{x_t}{n}$ is
called the sample mean of $\{X_t\}$. 2.
$c_k =\sum_{t=1}^{n−k} (x_{t+k}- \bar x)(x_t−\bar x)/n$ is known as the
sample autocovariance function of $\{X_t\}$. 3. $r_k = c_k /c_0$ is said
to be the sample autocorrelation function of $\{X_t\}$.

Note the following remarks about this definition:

-   Like most literature, this guide uses ACF to denote the sample
    autocorrelation function as well as the autocorrelation function.
    What is denoted by ACF can easily be identified in context.

-   Clearly c0 is the sample variance of $\{X_t\}$. Besides,
    $r_0 = c_0/c_0 = 1$ and for any integer $k, |r_k| ≤ 1$.

-   When we compute the ACF of any sample series with a fixed length
    $n$, we cannot put too much confidence in the values of $r_k$ for
    large k’s, since fewer pairs of $(x_{t +k }, x_t )$ are available
    for calculating $r_k$ as $k$ is large. One rule of thumb is not to
    estimate $r_k$ for $k > n/3$, and another is $n ≥ 50, k ≤ n/4$. In
    any case, it is always a good idea to be careful.

-   We also compute the ACF of a nonstationary time series sample by
    Definition 1. In this case, however, the ACF or $r_k$ very slowly or
    hardly tapers off as $k$ increases.

-   Plotting the ACF $(r_k)$ against lag $k$ is easy but very helpful in
    analyzing time series sample. Such an ACF plot is known as a
    correlogram.

-   If $\{X_t\}$ is stationary with $E(X_t)=0$ and $\rho_k =0$ for all
    $k \neq 0$,thatis,itisa white noise series, then the sampling
    distribution of $r_k$ is asymptotically normal with the mean 0 and
    the variance of $1/n$. Hence, there is about 95% chance that $r_k$
    falls in the interval $[−1.96/√n, 1.96/√n]$.

Now we can give a summary that (1) if the time series plot of a time
series clearly shows a trend or/and seasonality, it is surely
nonstationary; (2) if the ACF $r_k$ very slowly or hardly tapers off as
lag $k$ increases, the time series should also be nonstationary.

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2)

plot_acf(df["y"],  lags=30, ax=axs[0],color="fuchsia")
axs[0].set_title("Autocorrelation");

# Grafico

axs[1].set_title('Partial Autocorrelation')
plt.savefig("../../figs/prediction_intervals_in_forecasting_models__autocorrelation.png", bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close();
```

## Decomposition of the time series

How to decompose a time series and why?

In time series analysis to forecast new values, it is very important to
know past data. More formally, we can say that it is very important to
know the patterns that values follow over time. There can be many
reasons that cause our forecast values to fall in the wrong direction.
Basically, a time series consists of four components. The variation of
those components causes the change in the pattern of the time series.
These components are:

-   **Level:** This is the primary value that averages over time.
-   **Trend:** The trend is the value that causes increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Seasonality:** This is a cyclical event that occurs in a time
    series for a short time and causes short-term increasing or
    decreasing patterns in a time series.
-   **Residual/Noise:** These are the random variations in the time
    series.

Combining these components over time leads to the formation of a time
series. Most time series consist of level and noise/residual and trend
or seasonality are optional values.

If seasonality and trend are part of the time series, then there will be
effects on the forecast value. As the pattern of the forecasted time
series may be different from the previous time series.

The combination of the components in time series can be of two types: \*
Additive \* multiplicative

Additive time series

If the components of the time series are added to make the time series.
Then the time series is called the additive time series. By
visualization, we can say that the time series is additive if the
increasing or decreasing pattern of the time series is similar
throughout the series. The mathematical function of any additive time
series can be represented by:
$$y(t) = level + Trend + seasonality + noise$$

## Multiplicative time series

If the components of the time series are multiplicative together, then
the time series is called a multiplicative time series. For
visualization, if the time series is having exponential growth or
decline with time, then the time series can be considered as the
multiplicative time series. The mathematical function of the
multiplicative time series can be represented as.

$$y(t) = Level * Trend * seasonality * Noise$$

### Additive

```python
a = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "additive", period=24).plot()
a.savefig('../../figs/prediction_intervals_in_forecasting_models__seasonal_decompose_aditive.png', bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()
```

### Multiplicative

```python
b = seasonal_decompose(df["y"], model = "Multiplicative", period=24).plot()
b.savefig('../../figs/prediction_intervals_in_forecasting_models__seasonal_decompose_multiplicative.png', bbox_inches='tight')

# Split the data into training and testing

Let’s divide our data into sets 1. Data to train our model. 2. Data to
test our model

For the test data we will use the last 500 hours to test and evaluate
the performance of our model.

```python
train = df[df.ds<='2015-01-21 13:30:00'] 
test = df[df.ds>'2015-01-21 13:30:00']
```


```python
train.shape, test.shape
```

``` text
((9820, 3), (500, 3))
```

Now let’s plot the training data and the test data.

```python
fig = plot_series(train,test)
```

# Modeling with mlforecast

## Building Model

We define the model that we want to use, for our example we are going to
use the `XGBoost model`.

```python
model1 = [xgb.XGBRegressor()]
```

We can use the
[`MLForecast.preprocess`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.preprocess)
method to explore different transformations.

If it is true that the series we are working with is a stationary series
see (Dickey fuller test), however for the sake of practice and
instruction in this guide, we will apply the difference to our series,
we will do this using the `target_transforms parameter` and calling the
diff function like:
[`mlforecast.target_transforms.Differences`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/target_transforms.html#differences)

```python
mlf = MLForecast(models=model1,
                 freq='30min', 
                 target_transforms=[Differences([1])],
                 )
```

It is important to take into account when we use the parameter
`target_transforms=[Differences([1])]` in case the series is stationary
we can use a difference, or in the case that the series is not
stationary, we can use more than one difference so that the series is
constant over time, that is, that it is constant in mean and in
variance.

```python
prep = mlf.preprocess(df)
prep
```

|       | ds                  | y       | unique_id |

| 10319 | 2015-01-31 23:30:00 | -303.0  | 1         |

This has subtacted the lag 1 from each value, we can see what our series
look like now.

```python
fig = plot_series(prep)
```

## Adding features

### Lags

Looks like the seasonality is gone, we can now try adding some lag
features.

```python
mlf = MLForecast(models=model1,
                 freq='30min',  
                 lags=[1,24],
                 target_transforms=[Differences([1])],
                 )
```


```python
prep = mlf.preprocess(df)
prep
```

|       | ds                  | y      | unique_id | lag1   | lag24   |
|-------|---------------------|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 25    | 2014-07-01 12:30:00 | -22.0  | 1         | 445.0  | -2717.0 |
| 26    | 2014-07-01 13:00:00 | -708.0 | 1         | -22.0  | -1917.0 |
| 27    | 2014-07-01 13:30:00 | 1281.0 | 1         | -708.0 | -1554.0 |
| 28    | 2014-07-01 14:00:00 | 87.0   | 1         | 1281.0 | -836.0  |
| 29    | 2014-07-01 14:30:00 | 1045.0 | 1         | 87.0   | -947.0  |
| ...   | ...                 | ...    | ...       | ...    | ...     |
| 10315 | 2015-01-31 21:30:00 | 951.0  | 1         | 428.0  | 4642.0  |
| 10316 | 2015-01-31 22:00:00 | 1051.0 | 1         | 951.0  | -519.0  |
| 10317 | 2015-01-31 22:30:00 | 1588.0 | 1         | 1051.0 | 2411.0  |
| 10318 | 2015-01-31 23:00:00 | -718.0 | 1         | 1588.0 | 214.0   |
| 10319 | 2015-01-31 23:30:00 | -303.0 | 1         | -718.0 | 2595.0  |

```python
prep.drop(columns=['unique_id', 'ds']).corr()['y']
```

``` text
y        1.000000
lag1     0.663082
lag24    0.155366
Name: y, dtype: float64
```

## Lag transforms

Lag transforms are defined as a dictionary where the keys are the lags
and the values are lists of functions that transform an array. These
must be [numba](http://numba.pydata.org) jitted functions (so that
computing the features doesn’t become a bottleneck). There are some
implemented in the [window-ops
package](https://github.com/jmoralez/window_ops) but you can also
implement your own.

If the function takes two or more arguments you can either:

-   supply a tuple (tfm_func, arg1, arg2, …)
-   define a new function fixing the arguments

```python
from numba import njit
from window_ops.expanding import expanding_mean
from window_ops.rolling import rolling_mean
```


```python
mlf = MLForecast(models=model1,
                 freq='30min',  
                 lags=[1,24],
                 lag_transforms={1: [expanding_mean],24: [(rolling_mean, 7)] },
                 target_transforms=[Differences([1])],
                 )
```


```python
prep = mlf.preprocess(df)
prep
```

You can see that both approaches get to the same result, you can use
whichever one you feel most comfortable with.

## Date features

If your time column is made of timestamps then it might make sense to
extract features like week, dayofweek, quarter, etc. You can do that by
passing a list of strings with pandas time/date components. You can also
pass functions that will take the time column as input, as we’ll show
here.

```python
mlf = MLForecast(models=model1,
                 freq='30min', 
                 lags=[1,24],
                 lag_transforms={1: [expanding_mean],24: [(rolling_mean, 7)] },
                 target_transforms=[Differences([1])],
                 date_features=["year", "month", "day", "hour"]) # Seasonal data
```


```python
prep = mlf.preprocess(df)
prep
```

## Fit the Model

```python
# fit the models
mlf.fit(df,  
 fitted=True, 
prediction_intervals=PredictionIntervals(n_windows=5, h=30, method="conformal_distribution" )  )
```

``` text
MLForecast(models=[XGBRegressor], freq=<30 * Minutes>, lag_features=['lag1', 'lag24', 'expanding_mean_lag1', 'rolling_mean_lag24_window_size7'], date_features=['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour'], num_threads=1)
```

Let’s see the results of our model in this case the `XGBoost model`. We
can observe it with the following instruction:

Let us now visualize the fitted values of our models.

```python
result=mlf.forecast_fitted_values()
result=result.set_index("unique_id")

```python
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import normal_ad
from scipy import stats
```


```python
sw_result = stats.shapiro(result["XGBRegressor"])
ad_result = normal_ad(np.array(result["XGBRegressor"]), axis=0)
dag_result = stats.normaltest(result["XGBRegressor"], axis=0, nan_policy='propagate')
```

It’s important to note that we can only use this method if we assume
that the residuals of our validation predictions are normally
distributed. To see if this is the case, we will use a PP-plot and test
its normality with the Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and
D’Agostino K^2 tests.

The PP-plot(Probability-to-Probability) plots the data sample against
the normal distribution plot in such a way that if normally distributed,
the data points will form a straight line.

The three normality tests determine how likely a data sample is from a
normally distributed population using p-values. The null hypothesis for
each test is that “the sample came from a normally distributed
population”. This means that if the resulting p-values are below a
chosen alpha value, then the null hypothesis is rejected. Thus there is
evidence to suggest that the data comes from a non-normal distribution.
For this article, we will use an Alpha value of 0.01.

```python
result=mlf.forecast_fitted_values()
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2)

# plot[1,1]
result["XGBRegressor"].plot(ax=axs[0,0])
axs[0,0].set_title("Residuals model");

# plot

axs[0,1].set_title("Density plot - Residual");

# plot

## Predict method with prediction intervals

To generate forecasts use the predict method.

```python
forecast_df = mlf.predict(h=30, level=[80,95])
forecast_df.head()
```

## Plot prediction intervals

Now let’s visualize the result of our forecast and the historical data
of our time series, also let’s draw the confidence interval that we have
obtained when making the prediction with 95% confidence.

```python
fig = plot_series(df, forecast_df, level=[80,95], max_insample_length=200,engine="matplotlib")
fig.get_axes()[0].set_title("Prediction intervals")
fig.savefig('../../figs/prediction_intervals_in_forecasting_models__plot_forecasting_intervals.png', bbox_inches='tight')
```

The confidence interval is a range of values that has a high probability
of containing the true value of a variable. In machine learning time
series models, the confidence interval is used to estimate the
uncertainty in the predictions.

One of the main benefits of using the confidence interval is that it
allows users to understand the accuracy of the predictions. For example,
if the confidence interval is very wide, it means that the prediction is
less accurate. Conversely, if the confidence interval is very narrow, it
means that the prediction is more accurate.

Another benefit of the confidence interval is that it helps users make
informed decisions. For example, if a prediction is within the
confidence interval, it means that it is likely to come true.
Conversely, if a prediction is outside the confidence interval, it means
that it is less likely to come true.

In general, the confidence interval is an important tool for machine
learning time series models. It helps users understand the accuracy of
the forecasts and make informed decisions.
