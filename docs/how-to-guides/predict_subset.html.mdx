title: Predicting a subset of ids

---

```python
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
from fastcore.test import test_fail

from mlforecast import MLForecast
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(5)
fcst = MLForecast({'lgb': LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1)}, freq='D', date_features=['dayofweek'])
fcst.fit(series)
all_preds = fcst.predict(1)
all_preds
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | lgb      |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 3.728396 |
| 1   | id_1      | 2000-04-07 | 4.749133 |
| 2   | id_2      | 2000-06-16 | 4.749133 |
| 3   | id_3      | 2000-08-30 | 2.758949 |
| 4   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 3.331394 |

By default all series seen during training will be forecasted with the
predict method. If you’re only interested in predicting a couple of them
you can use the `ids` argument.

```python
fcst.predict(1, ids=['id_0', 'id_4'])
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | lgb      |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 3.728396 |
| 1   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 3.331394 |

Note that the ids must’ve been seen during training, if you try to
predict an id that wasn’t there you’ll get an error.

```python
test_fail(lambda: fcst.predict(1, ids=['fake_id']), contains='fake_id')
```
