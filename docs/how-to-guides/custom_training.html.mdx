> Customize the training procedure for your models

mlforecast abstracts away most of the training details, which is useful
for iterating quickly. However, sometimes you want more control over the
fit parameters, the data that goes into the model, etc. This guide shows
how you can train a model in a specific way and then giving it back to
mlforecast to produce forecasts with it.

## Data setup

```python
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(5)
```

## Creating forecast object

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

from mlforecast import MLForecast
```

Suppose we want to train a linear regression with the default settings.

```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    models={'lr': LinearRegression()},
    freq='D',
    lags=[1],
    date_features=['dayofweek'],
)
```

## Generate training set

Use `MLForecast.preprocess` to generate the training data.

```python
prep = fcst.preprocess(series)
prep.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y        | lag1     | dayofweek |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 1   | id_0      | 2000-01-02 | 1.423626 | 0.428973 | 6         |
| 2   | id_0      | 2000-01-03 | 2.311782 | 1.423626 | 0         |
| 3   | id_0      | 2000-01-04 | 3.192191 | 2.311782 | 1         |
| 4   | id_0      | 2000-01-05 | 4.148767 | 3.192191 | 2         |
| 5   | id_0      | 2000-01-06 | 5.028356 | 4.148767 | 3         |

```python
X = prep.drop(columns=['unique_id', 'ds', 'y'])
y = prep['y']
```

## Regular training

Since we don’t want to do anything special in our training process for
the linear regression, we can just call `MLForecast.fit_models`

```python
fcst.fit_models(X, y)
```

``` text
MLForecast(models=[lr], freq=D, lag_features=['lag1'], date_features=['dayofweek'], num_threads=1)
```

This has trained the linear regression model and is now available in the
`MLForecast.models_` attribute.

```python
fcst.models_
```

``` text
{'lr': LinearRegression()}
```

## Custom training

Now suppose you also want to train a LightGBM model on the same data,
but treating the day of the week as a categorical feature and logging
the train loss.

```python
model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=100, verbosity=-1)
model.fit(
    X,
    y,
    eval_set=[(X, y)],
    categorical_feature=['dayofweek'],
    callbacks=[lgb.log_evaluation(20)],
);
```

``` text
[20]    training's l2: 0.0823528
[40]    training's l2: 0.0230292
[60]    training's l2: 0.0207829
[80]    training's l2: 0.019675
[100]   training's l2: 0.018778
```

## Computing forecasts

Now we just assign this model to the `MLForecast.models_` dictionary.
Note that you can assign as many models as you want.

```python
fcst.models_['lgbm'] = model
fcst.models_
```

``` text
{'lr': LinearRegression(), 'lgbm': LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1)}
```

And now when calling `MLForecast.predict`, mlforecast will use those
models to compute the forecasts.

```python
fcst.predict(1)
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | lr       | lgbm     |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 3.549124 | 5.166797 |
| 1   | id_1      | 2000-04-07 | 3.154285 | 4.252490 |
| 2   | id_2      | 2000-06-16 | 2.880933 | 3.224506 |
| 3   | id_3      | 2000-08-30 | 4.061801 | 0.245443 |
| 4   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 2.904872 | 2.225106 |
