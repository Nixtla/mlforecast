mlforecast abstracts away most of the training details, which is useful
for iterating quickly. However, sometimes you want more control over the
fit parameters, the data that goes into the model, etc. This guide shows
how you can train a model in a specific way and then giving it back to
mlforecast to produce forecasts with it.

## Data setup

```python
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(5)
```

## Creating forecast object

```python
import numpy as np
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor

from mlforecast import MLForecast
```

Instantiate the forecast object without any models.

```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    freq='D',    
    models={},
    date_features=['dayofweek'],
)
```

## Generate training set

Use `MLForecast.preprocess` to generate the training data.

```python
prep = fcst.preprocess(series)
prep.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y        | dayofweek |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-01-01 | 0.428973 | 5         |
| 1   | id_0      | 2000-01-02 | 1.423626 | 6         |
| 2   | id_0      | 2000-01-03 | 2.311782 | 0         |
| 3   | id_0      | 2000-01-04 | 3.192191 | 1         |
| 4   | id_0      | 2000-01-05 | 4.148767 | 2         |

```python
X = prep.drop(columns=['unique_id', 'ds', 'y'])
y = prep['y']
```

## Training

Letâ€™s say you want to use sample weights to train the model, here we
just use random weights for simplicity.

```python
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
weights = rng.rand(y.size)
```

We train the model as we normally would and provide the weights through
the `sample_weight` argument.

```python
model = LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1).fit(X, y, sample_weight=weights)
```

## Computing forecasts

Now we just assign this model to the `MLForecast.models_` attribute.
Note that you can assign as many models as you want.

```python
fcst.models_ = {'lgbm': model, 'same_lgbm': model}
```

And now when calling `MLForecast.predict` mlforecast will use those
models to compute the forecasts.

```python
fcst.predict(1)
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | lgbm     | same_lgbm |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 3.642456 | 3.642456  |
| 1   | id_1      | 2000-04-07 | 4.808618 | 4.808618  |
| 2   | id_2      | 2000-06-16 | 4.808618 | 4.808618  |
| 3   | id_3      | 2000-08-30 | 2.777129 | 2.777129  |
| 4   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 3.404631 | 3.404631  |
