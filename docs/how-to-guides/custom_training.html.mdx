mlforecast abstracts away most of the training details, which is useful
for iterating quickly. However, sometimes you want more control over the
fit parameters, the data that goes into the model, etc. This guide shows
how you can train a model in a specific way and then giving it back to
mlforecast to produce forecasts with it.

## Data setup

```python
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(5)
```

## Creating forecast object

```python
import numpy as np
from lightgbm import LGBMRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

from mlforecast import MLForecast
```

Suppose we want to train a linear regression with the default settings.

```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    models={'lr': LinearRegression()},
    freq='D',
    date_features=['dayofweek'],
)
```

## Generate training set

Use
[`MLForecast.preprocess`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.preprocess)
to generate the training data.

```python
prep = fcst.preprocess(series)
prep.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y        | dayofweek |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|-----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-01-01 | 0.428973 | 5         |
| 1   | id_0      | 2000-01-02 | 1.423626 | 6         |
| 2   | id_0      | 2000-01-03 | 2.311782 | 0         |
| 3   | id_0      | 2000-01-04 | 3.192191 | 1         |
| 4   | id_0      | 2000-01-05 | 4.148767 | 2         |

```python
X = prep.drop(columns=['unique_id', 'ds', 'y'])
y = prep['y']
```

## Regular training

Since we donâ€™t want to do anything special in our training process for
the linear regression, we can just call
[`MLForecast.fit_models`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.fit_models)

```python
fcst.fit_models(X, y)
```

``` text
MLForecast(models=[lr], freq=<Day>, lag_features=[], date_features=['dayofweek'], num_threads=1)
```

This has trained the linear regression model and is now available in the
`MLForecast.models_` attribute.

```python
fcst.models_
```

``` text
{'lr': LinearRegression()}
```

## Custom training

Now suppose you also want to train a LightGBM model on the same data,
but specifying sample weights.

```python
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
weights = rng.rand(y.size)
```

We train the model as we normally would and provide the weights through
the `sample_weight` argument.

```python
model = LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1).fit(X, y, sample_weight=weights)
```

## Computing forecasts

Now we just assign this model to the `MLForecast.models_` dictionary.
Note that you can assign as many models as you want.

```python
fcst.models_['lgbm'] = model
fcst.models_
```

``` text
{'lr': LinearRegression(), 'lgbm': LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1)}
```

And now when calling
[`MLForecast.predict`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.predict),
mlforecast will use those models to compute the forecasts.

```python
fcst.predict(1)
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | lr       | lgbm     |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 3.247803 | 3.642456 |
| 1   | id_1      | 2000-04-07 | 3.182126 | 4.808618 |
| 2   | id_2      | 2000-06-16 | 3.182126 | 4.808618 |
| 3   | id_3      | 2000-08-30 | 3.313480 | 2.777129 |
| 4   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 3.444834 | 3.404631 |
