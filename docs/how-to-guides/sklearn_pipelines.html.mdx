title: Using scikit-learn pipelines
---


mlforecast takes scikit-learn estimators as models, which means you can
provide [scikit-learn’s
pipelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)
as models in order to further apply transformations to the data before
passing it to the model.

## Data setup

```python
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(5)
series.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y        |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-01-01 | 0.428973 |
| 1   | id_0      | 2000-01-02 | 1.423626 |
| 2   | id_0      | 2000-01-03 | 2.311782 |
| 3   | id_0      | 2000-01-04 | 3.192191 |
| 4   | id_0      | 2000-01-05 | 4.148767 |

## Pipelines definition

Suppose that you want to use a linear regression model with the lag1 and
the day of the week as features. mlforecast returns the day of the week
as a single column, however, that’s not the optimal format for a linear
regression model, which benefits more from having indicator columns for
each day of the week (removing one to avoid colinearity). We can achieve
this by using [scikit-learn’s
OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)
and then fitting our linear regression model, which we can do in the
following way:

```python
from mlforecast import MLForecast
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
```


```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    models=[],
    freq='D',
    lags=[1],
    date_features=['dayofweek']
)
X, y = fcst.preprocess(series, return_X_y=True)
X.head()
```

|     | lag1     | dayofweek |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| 1   | 0.428973 | 6         |
| 2   | 1.423626 | 0         |
| 3   | 2.311782 | 1         |
| 4   | 3.192191 | 2         |
| 5   | 4.148767 | 3         |

This is what will be passed to our model, so we’d like to get the
`dayofweek` column and perform one hot encoding, leaving the `lag1`
column untouched. We can achieve that with the following:

```python
ohe = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('encoder', OneHotEncoder(drop='first'), ['dayofweek'])
    ],
    remainder='passthrough',
)
X_transformed = ohe.fit_transform(X)
X_transformed.shape
```

``` text
(1096, 7)
```

We can see that our data now has 7 columns, 1 for the lag plus 6 for the
days of the week (we dropped the first one).

```python
ohe.get_feature_names_out()
```

``` text
array(['encoder__dayofweek_1', 'encoder__dayofweek_2',
       'encoder__dayofweek_3', 'encoder__dayofweek_4',
       'encoder__dayofweek_5', 'encoder__dayofweek_6', 'remainder__lag1'],
      dtype=object)
```

## Training

We can now build a pipeline that does this and then passes it to our
linear regression model.

```python
model = make_pipeline(ohe, LinearRegression())
```

And provide this as a model to mlforecast

```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    models={'ohe_lr': model},
    freq='D',
    lags=[1],
    date_features=['dayofweek']
)
fcst.fit(series)
```

``` text
MLForecast(models=[ohe_lr], freq=<Day>, lag_features=['lag1'], date_features=['dayofweek'], num_threads=1)
```

## Forecasting

Finally, we compute the forecasts.

```python
fcst.predict(1)
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | ohe_lr   |
|-----|-----------|------------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 4.312748 |
| 1   | id_1      | 2000-04-07 | 4.537019 |
| 2   | id_2      | 2000-06-16 | 4.160505 |
| 3   | id_3      | 2000-08-30 | 3.777040 |
| 4   | id_4      | 2001-01-08 | 2.676933 |

## Summary

You can provide complex scikit-learn pipelines as models to mlforecast,
which allows you to perform different transformations depending on the
model and use any of scikit-learn’s compatible estimators.
