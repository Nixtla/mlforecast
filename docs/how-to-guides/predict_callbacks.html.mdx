If you want to do something to the input before predicting or something
to the output before it gets used to update the target (and thus the
next features that rely on lags), you can pass a function to run at any
of these times.

Here are a couple of examples:

```python
import copy

import lightgbm as lgb
import numpy as np
from IPython.display import display

from mlforecast import MLForecast
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series
```


```python
series = generate_daily_series(1)
```

## Before predicting

### Inspecting the input

We can define a function that displays our input dataframe before
predicting.

```python
def inspect_input(new_x):
    """Displays the model inputs to inspect them"""
    display(new_x)
    return new_x
```

And now we can pass this function to the `before_predict_callback`
argument of
[`MLForecast.predict`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.predict).

```python
fcst = MLForecast(lgb.LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1), freq='D', lags=[1, 2])
fcst.fit(series, static_features=['unique_id'])
preds = fcst.predict(2, before_predict_callback=inspect_input)
preds
```

|     | unique_id | lag1    | lag2     |
|-----|-----------|---------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 4.15593 | 3.000028 |

|     | unique_id | lag1     | lag2    |
|-----|-----------|----------|---------|
| 0   | id_0      | 5.250205 | 4.15593 |

|     | unique_id | ds         | LGBMRegressor |
|-----|-----------|------------|---------------|
| 0   | id_0      | 2000-08-10 | 5.250205      |
| 1   | id_0      | 2000-08-11 | 6.241739      |

### Saving the input features

Saving the features that are sent as input to the model in each
timestamp can be helpful, for example to estimate SHAP values. This can
be easily achieved with the
[`SaveFeatures`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/callbacks.html#savefeatures)
callback.

```python
from mlforecast.callbacks import SaveFeatures
```


```python
fcst = MLForecast(lgb.LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1), freq='D', lags=[1])
fcst.fit(series, static_features=['unique_id'])
save_features_cbk = SaveFeatures()
fcst.predict(2, before_predict_callback=save_features_cbk);
```

Once weâ€™ve called predict we can just retrieve the features.

```python
save_features_cbk.get_features()
```

|     | unique_id | lag1     |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| 0   | id_0      | 4.155930 |
| 1   | id_0      | 5.281643 |

## After predicting

When predicting with the recursive strategy (the default) the
predictions for each timestamp are used to update the target and
recompute the features. If you want to do something to these predictions
before that happens you can use the `after_predict_callback` argument of
[`MLForecast.predict`](https://Nixtla.github.io/mlforecast/forecast.html#mlforecast.predict).

### Increasing predictions values

Suppose we know that our model always underestimates and we want to
prevent that from happening by making our predictions 10% higher. We can
achieve that with the following:

```python
def increase_predictions(predictions):
    """Increases all predictions by 10%"""
    return 1.1 * predictions
```


```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    {'model': lgb.LGBMRegressor(verbosity=-1)},
    freq='D',
    date_features=['dayofweek'],
)
fcst.fit(series)
original_preds = fcst.predict(2)
scaled_preds = fcst.predict(2, after_predict_callback=increase_predictions)
np.testing.assert_array_less(
    original_preds['model'].values,
    scaled_preds['model'].values,
)
```
