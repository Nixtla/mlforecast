title: Exogenous features

---

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
import pandas as pd
from mlforecast import MLForecast
from mlforecast.utils import generate_daily_series, generate_prices_for_series
from window_ops.expanding import expanding_mean
from window_ops.rolling import rolling_mean
```

## Data setup

```python
series = generate_daily_series(
    100, equal_ends=True, n_static_features=2
).rename(columns={'static_1': 'product_id'})
series.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y          | static_0 | product_id |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|
| 0   | id_00     | 2000-10-05 | 39.811983  | 79       | 45         |
| 1   | id_00     | 2000-10-06 | 103.274013 | 79       | 45         |
| 2   | id_00     | 2000-10-07 | 176.574744 | 79       | 45         |
| 3   | id_00     | 2000-10-08 | 258.987900 | 79       | 45         |
| 4   | id_00     | 2000-10-09 | 344.940404 | 79       | 45         |

In mlforecast the required columns are the series identifier, time and
target. Any extra columns you have, like `static_0` and `product_id`
here are considered to be static and are replicated when constructing
the features for the next timestamp. You can disable this by passing
`static_features` to `MLForecast.preprocess` or `MLForecast.fit`, which
will only keep the columns you define there as static. Keep in mind that
all features in your input dataframe will be used for training, so
youâ€™ll have to provide the future values of exogenous features to
`MLForecast.predict` through the `X_df` argument.

Consider the following example. Suppose that we have a prices catalog
for each id and date.

```python
prices_catalog = generate_prices_for_series(series)
prices_catalog.head()
```

|     | ds         | unique_id | price    |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| 0   | 2000-10-05 | id_00     | 0.548814 |
| 1   | 2000-10-06 | id_00     | 0.715189 |
| 2   | 2000-10-07 | id_00     | 0.602763 |
| 3   | 2000-10-08 | id_00     | 0.544883 |
| 4   | 2000-10-09 | id_00     | 0.423655 |

And that you have already merged these prices into your series
dataframe.

```python
series_with_prices = series.merge(prices_catalog, how='left')
series_with_prices.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y          | static_0 | product_id | price    |
|-----|-----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| 0   | id_00     | 2000-10-05 | 39.811983  | 79       | 45         | 0.548814 |
| 1   | id_00     | 2000-10-06 | 103.274013 | 79       | 45         | 0.715189 |
| 2   | id_00     | 2000-10-07 | 176.574744 | 79       | 45         | 0.602763 |
| 3   | id_00     | 2000-10-08 | 258.987900 | 79       | 45         | 0.544883 |
| 4   | id_00     | 2000-10-09 | 344.940404 | 79       | 45         | 0.423655 |

This dataframe will be passed to `MLForecast.fit` (or
`MLForecast.preprocess`). However, since the price is dynamic we have to
tell that method that only `static_0` and `product_id` are static.

```python
fcst = MLForecast(
    models=lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_jobs=1, random_state=0, verbosity=-1),
    freq='D',
    lags=[7],
    lag_transforms={
        1: [expanding_mean],
        7: [(rolling_mean, 14)]
    },
    date_features=['dayofweek', 'month'],
    num_threads=2,
)
fcst.fit(series_with_prices, static_features=['static_0', 'product_id'])
```

``` text
MLForecast(models=[LGBMRegressor], freq=<Day>, lag_features=['lag7', 'expanding_mean_lag1', 'rolling_mean_lag7_window_size14'], date_features=['dayofweek', 'month'], num_threads=2)
```

The features used for training are stored in
`MLForecast.ts.features_order_`. As you can see `price` was used for
training.

```python
fcst.ts.features_order_
```

``` text
['static_0',
 'product_id',
 'price',
 'lag7',
 'expanding_mean_lag1',
 'rolling_mean_lag7_window_size14',
 'dayofweek',
 'month']
```

So in order to update the price in each timestep we just call
`MLForecast.predict` with our forecast horizon and pass the prices
catalog through `X_df`.

```python
preds = fcst.predict(h=7, X_df=prices_catalog)
preds.head()
```
