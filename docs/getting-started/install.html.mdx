## Released versions

### PyPI

#### Latest release

To install the latest release of mlforecast from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlforecast/) you just have to run the
following in a terminal:

`pip install mlforecast`

#### Specific version

If you want a specific version you can include a filter, for example:

-   `pip install "mlforecast==0.3.0"` to install the 0.3.0 version
-   `pip install "mlforecast<0.4.0"` to install any version prior to
    0.4.0

#### Extras

##### Built-in transformations

We have implemented several lag transformations and target
transformations in
[coreforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/coreforecast) which you can get
with the following:

`pip install "mlforecast[lag_transforms]"`

##### Saving to remote storages

If you want to save your forecast artifacts to a remote storage like S3
or GCS you can use the following extras:

its extra:

#### Latest release

The mlforecast package is also published to
[conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlforecast), which you
can install by running the following in a terminal:

Note that this happens about a day later after it is published to PyPI,

    version prior to 0.4.0

## Development version

yet you have the following options:

-   Install from github:
    `pip install git+https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast`
-   Clone and install:
    `git clone https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast mlforecast-dev && pip install mlforecast-dev/`,
    which will install the version from the current main branch.
