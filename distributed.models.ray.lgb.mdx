---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> best_iteration_

:obj:`int`: The best iteration of fitted model if ``early_stopping()`` callback has been specified. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> best_score_

:obj:`dict`: The best score of fitted model. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> booster_

Booster: The underlying Booster of this model. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> evals_result_

:obj:`dict`: The evaluation results if validation sets have been specified. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> feature_importances_

:obj:`array` of shape = [n_features]: The feature importances (the higher, the more important). 

.. note:
``` 

     ``importance_type`` attribute is passed to the function      to configure the type of importance values to be extracted. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> feature_name_

:obj:`list` of shape = [n_features]: The names of features. 

.. note:
``` 

     If input does not contain feature names, they will be added during fitting in the format ``Column_0``, ``Column_1``, ..., ``Column_N``. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> feature_names_in_

:obj:`array` of shape = [n_features]: scikit-learn compatible version of ``.feature_name_``. 

.. versionadded:: 4.5.0 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> model_





---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> n_estimators_

:obj:`int`: True number of boosting iterations performed. 

This might be less than parameter ``n_estimators`` if early stopping was enabled or if boosting stopped early due to limits on complexity like ``min_gain_to_split``. 

.. versionadded:: 4.0.0 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> n_features_

:obj:`int`: The number of features of fitted model. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> n_features_in_

:obj:`int`: The number of features of fitted model. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> n_iter_

:obj:`int`: True number of boosting iterations performed. 

This might be less than parameter ``n_estimators`` if early stopping was enabled or if boosting stopped early due to limits on complexity like ``min_gain_to_split``. 

.. versionadded:: 4.0.0 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> objective_

:obj:`str` or :obj:`callable`: The concrete objective used while fitting this model.
