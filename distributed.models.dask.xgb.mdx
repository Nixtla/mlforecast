---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> best_iteration

The best iteration obtained by early stopping.  This attribute is 0-based, for instance if the best iteration is the first round, then best_iteration is 0. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> best_score

The best score obtained by early stopping. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> client

The dask client used in this model.  The `Client` object can not be serialized for transmission, so if task is launched from a worker instead of directly from the client process, this attribute needs to be set at that worker. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> coef_

Coefficients property 

.. note:: Coefficients are defined only for linear learners 

 Coefficients are only defined when the linear model is chosen as  base learner (`booster=gblinear`). It is not defined for other base  learner types, such as tree learners (`booster=gbtree`). 

Returns 
------- coef_ : array of shape ``[n_features]`` or ``[n_classes, n_features]`` 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> feature_importances_

Feature importances property, return depends on `importance_type` parameter. When model trained with multi-class/multi-label/multi-target dataset, the feature importance is "averaged" over all targets. The "average" is defined based on the importance type. For instance, if the importance type is "total_gain", then the score is sum of loss change for each split from all trees. 

Returns 
------- feature_importances_ : array of shape ``[n_features]`` except for multi-class linear model, which returns an array with shape `(n_features, n_classes)` 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> feature_names_in_

Names of features seen during :py:meth:`fit`.  Defined only when `X` has feature names that are all strings. 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> intercept_

Intercept (bias) property 

For tree-based model, the returned value is the `base_score`. 

Returns 
------- intercept_ : array of shape ``(1,)`` or ``[n_classes]`` 

---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> model_





---

#### <kbd>property</kbd> n_features_in_

Number of features seen during :py:meth:`fit`.
