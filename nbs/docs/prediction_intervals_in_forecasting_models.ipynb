    "The target of our prediction is something unknown (otherwise we wouldn't be making a prediction), so we can think of it as a random variable. For example, the total sales for the next month could have different possible values, and we won't know what the exact value will be until we get the actual sales at the end of the month. Until next month's sales are known, this is a random amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the time the next month draws near, we usually have a pretty good idea of possible sales values. However, if we are forecasting sales for the same month next year, the possible values can vary much more. In most forecasting cases, the variability associated with what we are forecasting reduces as we get closer to the event. In other words, the further back in time we make the prediction, the more uncertainty there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine many possible future scenarios, each yielding a different value for what we are trying to forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we obtain a forecast, we are estimating the middle of the range of possible values the random variable could take. Often, a forecast is accompanied by a prediction interval giving a range of values the random variable could take with relatively high probability. For example, a 95% prediction interval contains a range of values which should include the actual future value with probability 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than plotting individual possible futures , we usually show these prediction intervals instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we generate a forecast, we usually produce a single value known as the point forecast. This value, however, doesn’t tell us anything about the uncertainty associated with the forecast. To have a measure of this uncertainty, we need prediction intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction interval is a range of values that the forecast can take with a given probability. Hence, a 95% prediction interval should contain a range of values that include the actual future value with probability 95%. Probabilistic forecasting aims to generate the full forecast distribution. Point forecasting, on the other hand, usually returns the mean or the median or said distribution. However, in real-world scenarios, it is better to forecast not only the most probable future outcome, but many alternative outcomes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that some timeseries models provide forecast distributions, but some other ones only provide point forecasts. How can we then estimate the uncertainty of predictions?"

    "There are at least four sources of uncertainty in forecasting using time series models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The random error term;\n",
    "2. The parameter estimates;\n",
    "3. The choice of model for the historical data;\n",

    "When we produce prediction intervals for time series models, we generally only take into account the first of these sources of uncertainty. It would be possible to account for 2 and 3 using simulations, but that is almost never done because it would take too much time to compute. As computing speeds increase, it might become a viable approach in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we ignore the model uncertainty and the DGP uncertainty (sources 3 and 4), and just try to allow for parameter uncertainty as well as the random error term (sources 1 and 2), there are no closed form solutions apart from some simple special cases. see full article [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/narrow-pi/)\n"

    "## Forecast distributions\n",
    "We use forecast distributions to express the uncertainty in our predictions. These probability distributions describe the probability of observing different future values using the fitted model. The point forecast corresponds to the mean of this distribution. Most time series models generate forecasts that follow a normal distribution, which implies that we assume that possible future values follow a normal distribution. However, later in this section we will look at some alternatives to normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Confidence Interval Prediction in Time Series:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uncertainty Estimation: The confidence interval provides a measure of the uncertainty associated with time series predictions. It enables variability and the range of possible future values to be quantified, which is essential for making informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Precision evaluation: By having a confidence interval, the precision of the predictions can be evaluated. If the interval is narrow, it indicates that the forecast is more accurate and reliable. On the other hand, if the interval is wide, it indicates greater uncertainty and less precision in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Risk management: The confidence interval helps in risk management by providing information about possible future scenarios. It allows identifying the ranges in which the real values could be located and making decisions based on those possible scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective communication: The confidence interval is a useful tool for communicating predictions clearly and accurately. It allows the variability and uncertainty associated with the predictions to be conveyed to the stakeholders, avoiding a wrong or overly optimistic interpretation of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, confidence interval prediction in time series is essential to understand and manage uncertainty, assess the accuracy of predictions, and make informed decisions based on possible future scenarios."

For example, a calibrated 95% prediction interval should contain the true value 95% of the time in repeated sampling. An uncalibrated 95% prediction interval, on the other hand, might contain the true value only 80% of the time, or perhaps 99% of the time. In the first case, the interval is too narrow and underestimates the uncertainty, while in the second case, it is too wide and overestimates the uncertainty.\n",

    "## The Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n",
    "An Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is a type of statistical test that determines whether a unit root is present in time series data. Unit roots can cause unpredictable results in time series analysis. A null hypothesis is formed in the unit root test to determine how strongly time series data is affected by a trend. By accepting the null hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is not stationary. By rejecting the null hypothesis or accepting the alternative hypothesis, we accept the evidence that the time series data is generated by a stationary process. This process is also known as stationary trend. The values of the ADF test statistic are negative. Lower ADF values indicate a stronger rejection of the null hypothesis.\n",

    "1. $\\bar x = \\sum_{t=1}^n \\frac{x_t}{n}$ is called the sample mean of $\\{X_t\\}$.\n",

    "3. $r_k = c_k /c_0$ is said to be the sample autocorrelation function of $\\{X_t\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the following remarks about this definition:\n",
    " \n",
    "* Like most literature, this guide uses ACF to denote the sample autocorrelation function as well as the autocorrelation function. What is denoted by ACF can easily be identified in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly c0 is the sample variance of $\\{X_t\\}$. Besides, $r_0 = c_0/c_0 = 1$ and for any integer $k, |r_k| ≤ 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we compute the ACF of any sample series with a fixed length $n$, we cannot put too much confidence in the values of $r_k$ for large k’s, since fewer pairs of $(x_{t +k }, x_t )$ are available for calculating $r_k$ as $k$ is large. One rule of thumb is not to estimate $r_k$ for $k > n/3$, and another is $n ≥ 50, k ≤ n/4$. In any case, it is always a good idea to be careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We also compute the ACF of a nonstationary time series sample by Definition 1. In this case, however, the ACF or $r_k$ very slowly or hardly tapers off as $k$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Plotting the ACF $(r_k)$ against lag $k$ is easy but very helpful in analyzing time series sample. Such an ACF plot is known as a correlogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $\\{X_t\\}$ is stationary with $E(X_t)=0$ and $\\rho_k =0$ for all $k \\neq 0$,thatis,itisa white noise series, then the sampling distribution of $r_k$ is asymptotically normal with the mean 0 and the variance of $1/n$. Hence, there is about 95% chance that $r_k$ falls in the interval $[−1.96/√n, 1.96/√n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can give a summary that (1) if the time series plot of a time series clearly shows a trend or/and seasonality, it is surely nonstationary; (2) if the ACF $r_k$ very slowly or hardly tapers off as lag $k$ increases, the time series should also be nonstationary."

The null hypothesis for each test is that \"the sample came from a normally distributed population\". This means that if the resulting p-values are below a chosen alpha value, then the null hypothesis is rejected. Thus there is evidence to suggest that the data comes from a non-normal distribution. For this article, we will use an Alpha value of 0.01."
