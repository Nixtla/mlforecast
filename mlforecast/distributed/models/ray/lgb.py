    The booster's parameters are taken as ``**kwargs`` and handled by
    ``LGBMRegressor`` itself; ``num_workers`` and ``resources_per_worker`` are
    keyword only so that they can't collide with them.

    ``num_workers`` sets the number of ray train workers. The previous
    ``lightgbm_ray`` based implementation derived that from ``n_jobs``
    (``RayParams(num_actors=n_jobs)``); ``n_jobs`` is now the per worker thread
    count, as it is for the local estimator.

    ``fit`` takes a ray ``Dataset`` and a target column rather than the sklearn
    ``(X, y)`` pair, as the previous implementation did, so the inherited
    ``predict``/``score`` can't be used before fitting. The fitted estimator is
    exposed as ``model_``, a local ``lightgbm.LGBMRegressor`` that is sent to the
    workers in the forecasting step.
