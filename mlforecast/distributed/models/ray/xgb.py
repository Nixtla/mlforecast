class RayXGBForecast(RayForecastBase, xgb.XGBRegressor):
    """XGBoost forecaster trained with `ray.train.xgboost.XGBoostTrainer`.

    The booster's parameters are taken as ``**kwargs`` and handled by
    ``XGBRegressor`` itself; the ray arguments are keyword only
    so that they can't collide with them.

    ``num_workers`` sets the number of ray train workers. The previous
    ``xgboost_ray`` based implementation derived that from ``n_jobs``
    (``RayParams(num_actors=n_jobs)``); ``n_jobs`` is now the per worker thread
    count, as it is for the local estimator.

    ``resources_per_worker`` is the CPU knob: it decides how many CPUs each
    worker is given and therefore how many threads the booster can use. It
    defaults to the cluster's CPUs split evenly across the workers, as
    ``xgboost_ray._autodetect_resources`` did, and ``n_jobs`` can only lower it
    below that share. ``model_`` keeps the requested ``n_jobs`` rather than the clamp.

    ``storage_path`` is where ray train writes the run. It defaults to a
    temporary directory that is discarded once the fitted model has been read
    back, so that ``~/ray_results`` doesn't grow by a run per model per fit; as
    with ray's own default, a local path only works on a single node, so point
    it at shared storage for a multi node cluster.

    ``fit`` takes a ray ``Dataset`` and a target column rather than the sklearn
    ``(X, y)`` pair, as the previous implementation did, so the inherited
    ``predict``/``score`` can't be used before fitting. The fitted estimator is
    exposed as ``model_``, a local ``xgboost.XGBRegressor`` that is sent to the
    workers in the forecasting step.
